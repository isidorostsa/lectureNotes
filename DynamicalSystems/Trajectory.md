The [[trajectory]] a.k.a. the orbit of a system is the [[State Variables]] evolution in the [[state space]] through time from the [[Initial Conditions]]. 

A dynamical system is represented by a system of DEs (Difference Equations in the discrete case). In the continuous case, according to the *Picard-Lindelof* **Theorem** as long as the [[Evolution Function]] is [[Lipschitz continuous]], then there exists a **unique** solution to the system, a.k.a. a trajectory starting from $\vec {x}_0$ into infinity. For the discrete case it's trivial that the solution is unique.
