Main model is:$$\dot{x}(t) = f \lbrack x(t), u(t), t \rbrack$$ where $x, u, f \in \mathbb{R}^n$ 

- e.g. $f$ can be linear: $$f = A(t)x + b(t)u$$
We study known input -> known output

### Controllers:
- Static state feedback:$$u = u(x, t)$$
- Dynamic state feedback:$$u = u(z, x, t),\newline \dot{z} = g(z, x, t)$$
