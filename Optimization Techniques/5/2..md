We use the general method of:$$x_{k+1}=x_{k} - \gamma_{k} \Delta_{k} \nabla f(x_{k})$$
where $\Delta_{k}$ is a summetric positive definite matrix. This multiplication has the effect of normalizing the importance of $f$'s variables.

### Steepest Descent
Here $$\begin{align*}
\Delta_{k}&=I \implies \\\\
x_{k+1}&=x_{k} - \gamma_{k} \nabla f(x_{k})
\end{align*}$$
and on each step we pick the $\gamma_{k}$ that minimizes $f(x_{k} - \gamma_{k} \nabla f(x_{k}))$ by solving
