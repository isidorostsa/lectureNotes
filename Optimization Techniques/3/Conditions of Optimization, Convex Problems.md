Sample Problem:$$\text{Find } x \in X \subset R^{n} \text{ to minimize } f(x) \text{ and satisfy } g_{i}(x) \le 0, \space i = 1,2,\dots,m$$
- $f$ is called _objective function_
- $g_{i}$ are called _constraints_
- every $x \in X$ that satisfies the _constraints_ is called a _feasible point_ of the problem
- The set $F: \set{x \in X: g_{i}(x) \le 0, \space i = 1, 2,\dots, m}$ of _feasible points_ is called the _feasible region_ of the problem.
- If $F \neq 0$ The Problem is called _Consistent_
- If $\exists x \in F : g_{i}<0, \space i = 1,2,\dots,m$ the problem is called _super - consistent_. 

If $\exists x^{\star} \in F: f(x^{\star}) \le f(x), \space  \forall x \in F$ then $x^{\star}$ is called a _Solution_ to the problem.
