Sample Problem:$$\text{Find } x \in X \subset R^{n} \text{ to minimize } f(x) \text{ and satisfy } g_{i}(x) \le 0, \space i = 1,2,\dots,m$$
- $f$ is called _objective function_
- $g_{i}$ are called _constraints_
- every $x \in X$ that satisfies the _constraints_ is called a _possible point_ of the problem
- $F$
- If $X \neq 0$ then
