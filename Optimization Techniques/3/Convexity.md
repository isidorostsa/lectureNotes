## Convex Set
A set $S \subseteq R^n$ is called convex iff:$$\forall x, y \in S: \lambda x + (1 - \lambda ) y = z \in S, \space \forall \lambda \in [0, 1]$$
### Theorem 3.1.1
For $S$ _convex_, $x_{1},...,x_{k} \in S$ then for $\lambda_{1},...,  \lambda_{k}$ with $\sum \lambda_{i} = 1$ then:$$\sum_{i} \lambda_{i}x_i \in S$$
This sum is called a _Convex combination of $x_{1}...x_{n}$_
- The set of the _convex combinations_ of any $n$ vectors of $R^k$ is the hyper-polygon traced by them

## Convex Function
For $f: S\to R$ where $S \subseteq R^{n}$ is convex,
