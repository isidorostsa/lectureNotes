A relation between two [[choices]], denoted by $\succeq$ .

For $x, y \in X$:
- If $x$ is *at least as good* as $y$: $x \succsim y$ 
- If $x$ is *indefferent* to $y$ we write: $x \sim y$ 
- If $x$ is *strictly better* than $y$ we write: $x \succ y$ 

Preference exists as a notion only if we we assume the [[rationality]] of the desicion maker.
