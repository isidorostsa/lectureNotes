The signal space is a vector space of [[Signal|signals]]. 
Its basic properties and definitions are:
- [[Norm]]: $||s(t)||$
- [[Inner Product]]: $<s_1, s_2>$ 
- [[Orthogonality]] 
- [[Simmilarity]] 
- [[Eucledian Distance]]
- [[Cauchy-Swartz inequality]] 
- [[Parallelogram Rule]]
- [[Pythagorean Theorem]]

As the *signal space* is a vector space, it has a notion of [[linear dependance]], [[Dimension|dimensionality]] and [[Orthonormality|orthonormality]]. A collection of [[Signal|signals]] in the [[Signal Space]] is called a [[Constellation]].
