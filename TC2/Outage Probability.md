The probability of the bit rate going bellow the minimum needed to keep communication possible.$$P_{out} = Pr(C < R_t)$$Where $R_t$ is said minimum bit rate. But because we have a constant [[frequency range]] $W$, the bit rate is a [[Bit Rate|function]] of [[SNR]]. So then this formula becomes:$$P_{out} = Pr(\text{SNR} < \gamma_t)$$Where $\gamma_t$ is the [[SNR]] required to reach $R_t$.
