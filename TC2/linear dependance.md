A set of [[Signal|signals]] in the [[Signal Space]] is considered linearly dependent iff:$$\exists a_i \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ not all = 0}: \sum_{i=1}^{M}a_is_i(t) = 0,\forall t \geq0$$ an equilevant way of saying this is:$$\exists a_i\in \mathbb{R}: s_i(t) = \sum_{i\neq j}a_js_j(t), \forall t \geq 0$$A set of $M$ signals $s_i(t)$ is *linearly **in**dependent* iff there exists no set of $a_i$ to fullfill the properties described above.
